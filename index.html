	<h2> About Me </h2>
	
	<p>
	My name is Amber Gerard I was born and raised in Iowa City. I attended Regina till fourth grade when I switch to Longfellow. Of course that means I went to Southeast for my junior high and City High 
for highschool. I am currently a Senior at the University of Iowa. I am in both tracks for the BAIS major. I actually didn't start out at the University of Iowa
I actually went to University of Northern Iowa as a Freshman. I was not very happy at the school so I decided to transfer to kirkwood where I took classes that
I needed to take at Iowa and that would transfer after taking all the classes I could I transfered streight into the business school at Iowa. I have a younger 
sister called Amanda and because we both have names starting with A we get called eachothers name. I have also included my resume so if you would like to view it click

	<h2>Travel</h2>
	<p>
	I have traveled many places outside the United States. I went to Spain for two weeks for the highschool spanish trip that City High does every year the first part
of the week was spent walking around visiting the sights while the second week was spent at a host family house going to school. I have also been to mexico for vacation
with my family we mostly stayed at all inclusive resorts because of the safty but we have gone out and shopped around downtown. I have also been to China for two weeks and
this was done through a 2 week session study abroad program through the business school. We visited businesses in both Beiging and Shanghi to learn about businesses and
how they are run globally. We also got to see some sights like the Great Wall and other places. And the last place I have been to is Peru with my family. 
We really only went to Peru was because my sister had been studying over in Chile for about 6 months and since Peru has alot to do and see and is one of the more safer 
countries to visit we planned a family trip to there for 3 weeks during winter break. As you can see from my travel experience I love going to new places whether it be inside
or outside the United States.

	<h2>Sports</h2>
	<p>
I have to say the sport I love watching the most is football and this is mostly due to the fact that I know the rules and have been watching it since I was young. My favorite
team is the Hawkeyes for college and I rarly watch NFL football but if I were to pick a team I would probably support the Greenbay Packers. Another sport I love watching is soccer
I found I liked watching this sport when me and my sister watched the Copa America championship. This sport is entertaining to watch and because there are no time outs or anything it
goes at a fast pace. The last sport I don't mind watching is baseball but I have to say its more fun to watch the game at the stadium then watch it on tv. My favorite baseball team is
the cubs.
