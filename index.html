	<h2> About Me </h2>
	
	<p>
	My name is Amber Gerard I was born and raised in Iowa City. I am currently a Senior at the University of Iowa and I am in both tracks for the BAIS major. I chose to study business analytics and infosystems because I've always been interested in coding and how websites are made. I began my education at Kirkwood and transferred to Iowa my Junior year. I have a younger 
sister named Amanda who goes to school in Chicago. In my free time I like to hang out with friends, read fantasy books and listen to music.

	<h2>Travel</h2>
	<p>
	I have traveled many places outside the United States. I went to Spain for two weeks for a highschool spanish trip to learn more about the culture. The first part
of the week was spent walking around and visiting the sights while the second week was spent with a host family going to a local high school. I have also been to Mexico for vacation
with my family multiple times and Hawaii one time last summer. Last year I went to China for two weeks with a study abroad program through the business school. We visited businesses in Beiging and Shanghi to learn about businesses and
how they are run globally. Our free time was spent visiting cultural landmarks like the Great Wall of China. The most recent place I have been to is Peru with my family to visit my sister who was studying in South America. We spent three weeks in Peru over winter break and visited historical Incan landmarks, climbed Machu Picchu, and spent a week in the rain forest. As you can see from my travel experiences I love going to new places whether it be inside
or outside the United States.

	<h2>Sports</h2>
	<p>
The sport I love watching the most is football because I know the rules and have been watching it since I was young. My favorite college team is the Hawkeyes. I rarly watch NFL football but if I were to pick a team I would probably support the Greenbay Packers. Another sport I love watching is soccer.
I found I liked watching this sport when my sister and I watched the Copa America championship. I think soccer is entertaining to watch and because there are no time outs so it
goes at a fast pace. Sometimes I watch baseball but I think it is a lot more fun to watch the game at the stadium then watch it on tv. My favorite baseball team is
the Chicago Cubs.
